# Notes Web Application
A notes application that features a login system with email authentication. It sends an email upon account creation to confirm account. Once the account has been confirmed, then the user can login and create new notes. Authentication for nodemailer was stored in a .env file. The .env file contained the port, local MongoDB server url, email, password, and secret for the JWT. Passwords are stored securely after being passed through a hash and salt. This code isn't bundled the best for functional purposes. Refactoring to make each module cleaner may come in the future.
